# Gitignore

The .gitignore file is used in Git repositories to specify which files and directories should be excluded from version control. It helps to prevent certain files from being tracked, which is particularly useful for files that are generated automatically, contain sensitive information, or are specific to your local environment. When Git encounters a file or directory listed in .gitignore, it will ignore those items when making commits or comparisons.
