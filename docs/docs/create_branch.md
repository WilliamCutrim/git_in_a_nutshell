# Git and Bitbucket Branching

## What is Branching?
Branching in Git and Bitbucket allows developers to isolate their work from others, making it possible to work on multiple features or fixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.

## Commands for Git

* `git branch <name>` - Creates a new branch locally.
* `git checkout -b <name>` - Creates a new branch and switches to it.
* `git push -u origin <name>` - Pushes the new branch to the remote repository and sets up tracking.

## Commands for Bitbucket

1. **Navigate to the repository:** Open your repository in Bitbucket.
2. **Create a New Branch:** Click on 'Create branch' in the sidebar.
3. **Set Details:** Choose the branch name, type (feature, hotfix, etc.), and the base branch.
4. **Create:** Click 'Create' to finalize the branch creation.
